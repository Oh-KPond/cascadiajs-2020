excerpt: Register by JULY 24, and get a CascadiaJS hoodie & other cool swag delivered to your door in time for the conference!
---
Every conference attendee will recieve an awesome Goodie Box that will include a conference hoodie and other fun swag. Here's some important information for how these Goodie Boxes are being delivered to your home.

## If you registered before July 16

If you registered before July 16, you provided us with a hoodie size and shipping address during registration. A few important notes here:

### Check your email!

- We emailed ~65 people who had provided incomplete shipping address info.
- This issue affected all non-US (Canada, etc) attendees because our shipping vendor needs a phone number in order for the package to clear customs.

### If you've forgotten what hoodie size or address you provided

- Search your email for "Your CascadiaJS 2020 Ticket"
- Click the "Change Details" link
- This will show you what you entered when you registered
- **Do not** update this form. If you want to make a change, see below.

### If you registered *before* July 16 & you want to make a change to your shipping address or hoodie size

Send an email to info@cascadiajs.com **no later than Thursday, July 23**.

Please include:
- Your Ticket Reference (i.e. ABCD-1)
- Hoodie size
- Shipping address (including phone number for non-US addresses)

## If you registered on or after July 16

If you registered after July 16, we instead [directed you](/next-steps) to an external ecommerce site where you were able to choose your hoodie and enter your shipping information. 

## Sizing information

Here are the official sizing guides from the vendor we are using to produce the hoodies:

- Fitted - https://products.kotisdesign.com/size_charts/158
- Unisex - https://products.kotisdesign.com/size_charts/140
- Youth - http://www.apparelvideos.com/cs/CatalogBrowser?todo=mm&productId=993B

Notes: 

- These are the same hoodies we’ve used the last two years.
- The chest measurement for unisex is “single-sided”, while the fitted one is “all around”
